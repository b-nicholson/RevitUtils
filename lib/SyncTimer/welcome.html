<h1><strong>Welcome!</strong></h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Thanks for installing my extension. It is currently, and probably will forever be, a work in progress. If something goes wrong, or if you have any suggestions please let me know.</p>
    <p>It installs a new Tab at the top of the Revit Ribbon called <em>pyLoop</em> Inside are a variety of small tools that I will do my best to keep adding to.</p>
    <p>(Actually, I have decided to switch over to a proper add-in, which means I need to rewrite everything in a new programming language, please bear with me!)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are some utilities that work in the background which modify the way Revit operates, but are not immediately obvious that they&#39;re running. They are explained below:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Synchronize With Central Timer</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    This plugin will gradually change the colour of your <em>Application Ribbon</em> if you have not synced a workshared document in a user-specified duration. If you exceed the time, it will automatically switch your active tab to <em>Collaborate</em>, and highlight the <em>Synchronize</em> panel.
    </li>
    <li>
    You can adjust the timing and colour settings within the <em>Sync With Central Timer Settings</em> button inside of <em>pyLoop.</em>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Import CAD</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you try to import a CAD file inside of a project (not a family) it will produce a warning, but still allow you to do it if you REALLY need to. (but why!?)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Model In Place</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you try to create a Model in Place Component it will produce a warning, but still allow you to do it. This is a tool for mindfulness.</li>
    </ul>
        <p><strong>Printing With Closed Worksets</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you go to print with any worksets closed, it will warn you before you start the process.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Ungroup Groups</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>I dont know about you, but I misclick this a lot. No idea who thought having it beside Edit Group in the UI was a good idea. Not noticing it was accidentally ungrouped has bad consequences. The plugin will give you a warning before ungrouping.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>To make this pop-up stop appearing, Enter the Sync with Central Timer Settings and save your desired configuration.</strong> (This is deliberately obnoxious, sorry)</p>
    <p><strong>Cheers! - Blake</strong></p>
